			<div class="hlist"><p ><h4>Mega Man X</h4>This is my favorite video game ever(That I have played). It is the best Mega Man game. 2 is over rated.</p></div>
			<div class="hlist"><p><h4>Quality Youtube</h4>Most os Youtube is just cruddy lets plays, talk shows, pranks, and other general trash. Things like IHE and Jontron put real effort into their videos and the videos are of very high quality.</p></div>
			<div class="hlist"><p><h4>Animation</h4>Unlike most people, when watching animation, I take time to notice little quirks or techniques. Animation is very difficult, and shouldn't be discarded as just for kids.</p></div>
