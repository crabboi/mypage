			<p><h4>My "Story"</h4>
			I was born in the year 20XX. Created to be the ultimate cringe lord, I set on my mission to spam unfunny memes, gifs, and websites. Through the power of irony, I shall continue this quest.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><h4>My Mission</h4>My main mission is to make the world even more cringey than it already is. I want to learn how to program video games. I'm trying to become an artist. That's it.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="skillz">
		<p><h4>Skills?</h4>I guess I'm an okay artist. It'll bring more cringe than a syringe. I know how to play Street Fighter and Smash 4, but I'm not close to EVO material. I can program dumb websites.</p></div>
